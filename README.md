I did my Uni work experience through the Devmind workshop organized through Tap That Job, a project organized by ASE's student syndicate, entitled: Building a Full Stack ChatGPT-powered assistant for the Web. This is what I made building on top of the original application we all created together during that course. Currently only the front end part, built using React.

Repository with the original app's code: https://codeberg.org/axbg/talks/src/branch/main/workshop-ttj
